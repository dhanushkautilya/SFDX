#Lightning Datatable with Picklist inline editing and Color Disposition with the help of Custom Data Type:
The project detailed in the article focuses on creating a Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) solution that integrates a customizable data table with inline editing, picklist, and lookup functionalities. The solution enables users to edit multiple records on a single screen while enhancing the user experience through these specialized components. It involves backend development through Apex classes for retrieving and updating records, as well as frontend work using LWCs for the picklist and lookup fields. To build a data table with inline editing, picklist, and color disposition for customer SKU data, a CustomType is often used to define custom behavior for specific columns. 
->For example, a column displaying SKU status (such as "Available," "Low Stock," or "Discontinued") can utilize a CustomType to show a picklist for inline editing. Users can select from predefined values in the picklist directly within the table.
->Color disposition helps visually represent SKU statuses. The CustomType can be configured to apply dynamic CSS classes based on the SKU's status. For instance, "Available" items could appear in green, while "Low Stock" items would be red.
->To implement this, a custom Lightning Web Component (LWC) can use the lightning-datatable component to render the table. The inline editing feature is enabled by allowing the user to modify cells, which updates both the frontend table and the Salesforce backend via Apex controllers. The table dynamically reflects changes, including color changes for statuses.
DATA BEING DISPLAYED:
 SELECT Id, Product_Name__c, Sales_Disposition__c, New_Potential_ACV__c 
            FROM Customer_SKU_Heatmap__c 
            WHERE Account__c = :accountId  
            OR Sales_Disposition__c != null
            OR Status__c = 'Available' WITH SYSTEM_MODE
This approach ensures a rich, interactive user experience, improving efficiency in managing customer SKU data.
